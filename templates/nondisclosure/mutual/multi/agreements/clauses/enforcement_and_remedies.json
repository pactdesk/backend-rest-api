      "content": "The Receiving Party acknowledges that any breach or threatened breach of this Agreement may cause irreparable harm to the Disclosing Party, for which monetary damages may not be an adequate remedy. In such an event, the Disclosing Party shall be entitled to seek injunctive relief or other equitable remedies before a court of competent jurisdiction, in addition to any other legal remedies available under applicable law, including but not limited to claims for damages and reimbursement of legal costs. The availability of injunctive relief shall not preclude the Disclosing Party from pursuing any other rights or remedies it may have under this Agreement or by law."
